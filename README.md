# MPV Music Web UI

MPV Music Web UI has very self-descriptive name. It is based on ideas from https://github.com/lkotek/remote-mpv-control, but it serves different purpose. It is only focused to provide a Web UI (no focus to bluetooth etc) and to play only music files (no). Both should result into simpler and easier code to maintain.

Current status of project: an idea.
